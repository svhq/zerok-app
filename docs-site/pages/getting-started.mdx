# Getting Started

Make your first private transaction on ZeroK in five steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- **A Solana wallet** — [Phantom](https://phantom.app) or [Solflare](https://solflare.com) are supported
- **Some SOL** — enough to cover your deposit plus a small transaction fee
- **Some SOL for gas** — a standard Solana transaction fee (~0.000005 SOL)

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Open the ZeroK app and click **Connect Wallet**. Approve the connection in your wallet extension. ZeroK will detect your wallet and display your balance.

## Step 2: Select a Pool

Choose a pool denomination for your deposit. ZeroK offers several fixed-size pools — pick the one that matches how much SOL you want to make private. Each pool is separate, so you can only withdraw from the same denomination you deposited into.

## Step 3: Make Your Deposit

Click **Deposit** and approve the transaction in your wallet. Your deposit will confirm in under a second — that's Solana's fast finality at work.

## Step 4: Save Your Note

After your deposit confirms, ZeroK will display your **note**. This is a cryptographic secret that proves your deposit.

<Callout type="warning">
  **This is the most important step.** Your note is the ONLY way to withdraw your funds. If you lose it, your funds are permanently gone. No one — not even ZeroK — can recover them.

**How to save your note:**
- Click the **Download** button to save it as a file
- Store it somewhere safe — an encrypted folder, a password manager, or offline storage
- Consider making a backup copy in a second secure location

## What's Next?

Your deposit is now in the pool. When you're ready to withdraw:

1. Wait for more deposits to enter the pool (this strengthens your privacy)
2. Open a **different browser** or use a **fresh wallet** for the withdrawal
3. Follow the [Withdrawals](/withdrawals) guide
