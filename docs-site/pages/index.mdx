# Welcome to ZeroK

**Private transactions on Solana.**

ZeroK is a privacy-preserving protocol that lets you move SOL without exposing your transaction history. On public blockchains like Solana, every transfer is visible to anyone — your wallet balance, who you transact with, and when. ZeroK changes that.

## Why Privacy Matters

Solana is fast, cheap, and fully transparent. That transparency means:

- Anyone can look up your wallet and see your entire balance
- Every transaction you make is linked to your identity
- Merchants, employers, and strangers can trace your financial activity

Privacy isn't about hiding — it's about choice. You should decide who sees your financial activity, not the blockchain.

## What ZeroK Offers

- **Fully non-custodial** — you hold the keys, you generate the proofs, you control your funds at every step
- **Deposit-withdrawal unlinkability** — no one can connect your deposit to your withdrawal
- **No gas needed on withdrawal** — the protocol covers on-chain transaction costs so your recipient wallet stays clean
- **Fast finality** — deposits confirm in under a second on Solana
- **In-browser proof generation** — your private data never leaves your device

## How It Works (In 30 Seconds)

1. **Deposit** SOL into a fixed-size pool
2. **Save your note** — a cryptographic secret that proves your deposit
3. **Withdraw** later from a completely different wallet

Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that no one — not even ZeroK — can link your deposit to your withdrawal.
